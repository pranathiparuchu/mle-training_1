Median housing value prediction
The housing data can be downloaded from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ageron/handson-ml/master/. The script has codes to download the data. We have modelled the median house value on given housing data.

The following techniques have been used:

Linear regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Steps performed
We prepare and clean the data. We check and impute for missing values.
Features are generated and the variables are checked for correlation.
Multiple sampling techinuqies are evaluated. The data set is split into train and test.
All the above said modelling techniques are tried and evaluated. The final metric used to evaluate is mean squared error.

User Installation
Create an environment using deploy/conda/env.yaml file
conda env create -f deploy/conda/env.yaml
Note: The name of the environment is mle-dev-mlflow which can be found in the name section of env.yaml file

Activate the environment once environment is created
conda activate mle-dev-mlflow
To install housing_price package, run the below command:
python setup.py install
Note: All the above code commands expects you to run them in the root folder of the project.

Testing the installation
After activating mle-dev-mlflow environment, run the following command
python tests/installation_tests/housing_price_test.py
If there is no error, then the package installation is successful.

Note: All the above code commands expects you to run them in the root folder of the project.
